# 🎨 CSS Learning Journal

## 🗓️ Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### 🔹 Step (from Learning Path)
(e.g., Step 1: Typography & Spacing)

### 🔹 Goal
_What am I trying to improve or learn?_  
(e.g., Make text easier to read on blog posts)

### 🔹 Experiments
- [ ] Changed line-height from `1.4` → `1.6`
- [ ] Increased post title font-size from `1.3rem` → `1.6rem`
- [ ] Tried `text-transform: uppercase` on headings

### 🔹 Observations
- Line-height `1.6` looks much more readable  
- Bigger titles give better hierarchy → I’ll keep this  
- Uppercase titles look too “shouty” → I’ll revert  

### 🔹 Result
✅ Kept changes: line-height, title size  
❌ Reverted: uppercase titles  

### 🔹 Next Step
(What I want to try in my next session)  
(e.g., move to Step 2: Card hover effects)
